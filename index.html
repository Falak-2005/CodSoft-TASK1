            <h3>Ai Chatbot</h3>
            <p> We made this project during my diploma in cse using html, css, javascript, python and django. It was basically a webapp through which users can chat easily with bot and get solutions to their problems.The user were be able to search anything in the search option. The bot would reply back to the user as per its instructions. The users were able to search about study material, any courses, recipes, etc. without the fear of any data breach and could again visit the same search in future.
