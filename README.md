# CodSoft-TASK1
This is the whole code and images I used to create different projects during my internship in Web Development at CodSoft.

TASK 1- My first task was to create my own Portfolio. I have built this using HTML and CSS in which I have inserted my image to enhance the outlook of the portfolio, added different sections like header section, skills section, resume section, contact information, etc..
